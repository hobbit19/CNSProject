Many cryptocurrencies have come into existence in recent years, with Bitcoin
the most famous among them. One of the most attracting feature of these
currencies is the pseudo-anonymity: until a person you do not associate her
personal information to a certain address, the owner of a wallet remains
unknown. This property could be exploited in order to hide criminal
activities, but it is also essential to preserve users privacy. There are lots
of works that present techniques to preserve or augment the address privacy or
to de-anonymize them. In this paper we present a possible privacy threat,
binding wallet addresses to personal data of their owner. We exploit
information publicly available on the web and the fact that users do not change
their wallets at each transaction. In this way, it is not only possible to
associate a person to a wallet but it is also possible to search for people
that own multiple addresses, even if their are of different currencies.
