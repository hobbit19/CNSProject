\section{Results} \label{results}
After we implemented and tested \texttt{Nduja} we ran it. The first step
(\texttt{data retrieving}) of the algorithm  was performed between
17\textsuperscript{th} and 24\textsuperscript{th} February 2018 and gave us
\startingNumberAllWallets{} addresses, \startingNumberWalletsNotService{}
addresses that probably are not services, but we were able to attest that only
\startingNumberWalletsAtLeastOneTransaction{} of them had at least one
transaction. We found out \startingBTC{} Bitcoin addresses, \startingLTC{}
Litecoin addresses, \startingDOGE{} Dogecoin addresses, \startingETH{} Ethereum
addresses and finally \startingXMR{} Monero addresses. These results are
depicted in~\autoref{fig:numberaccountcurrency}.

As we expected the currency on which, potentially, we could retrieve more data
is still Bitcoin, even if the number of Ethereum public keys found is higher.
The altcoin that gave us the smaller set of results was Monero, with only
\startingXMR{}. There are several possible explanations: on one hand Monero has
a smaller userbase than the other examined currencies, on the other hand it was
born to preserve users' privacy, so people could be more aware to advertise it.
Wallets retrieved in this phase come from different sources, in particular:
\accountGithub{} were retrieved by searching Github, \accountTwitter{}
from Twitter. Exploiting Github search, we found other \accountBitcointalk{}
accounts that are related to \url{bitcointalk.org} forum, because one
of the repository listed them. Searchcode did not give us a serious improvement
because we were able only to retrieve other 3 addresses (\accountGitlab{} from
Gitlab and \accountBitbucket{} from Bitbucket) that were not already present in
the Github's wallets.
The clustering procedure of the algorithm was run between 9\textsuperscript{th}
and 20\textsuperscript{th} Match 2018 and \emph{only} on Litecoin and Dogecoin
addresses. We excluded Bitcoin wallets due to time constraints.
For further details we refer to~\autoref{sec:issues}. Ethereum and Monero were
not considered because the former does not allow multiple-input transactions,
so it is not possible to cluster wallets as for the other, instead the latter
has private transactions, so it is not possible to analyze its transaction
history. After clustering, we increase the total number of addresses discovered
to \clusteringNumberAllWallets{}, \clusteringNumberWalletsNotService{} of them
are not well-known services.
In~\autoref{fig:dogeltcclustered} is depicted the increase of the number of
wallets found.
Addresses are connected to \accountNumber{} accounts and on average we had
\avarageAccount{} addresses per person.
The distribution of the number of wallets per account is represented
in~\autoref{fig:numwall}. We considered only accounts with at most 28 related
wallets by setting a maximum limit on the number of
wallets to spare time.
Therefore if a wallet had more than 29 wallets we could not assert whether
the account had actually 29 addresses or more.
We were able to bind \facebookRelatedAccounts{} and \linkedinRelatedAccount{}
accounts to their Facebook and Linkedin contacts, respectively, and these two
sets do not have intersection. The latter social network is particularly
interesting because people are more likely to share sensitive data on this
platform because of its aim.
Finally, \accountRelated{} accounts in our database are strongly related with
at least another one: this means that one of their addresses are used together
as input in the same Dogecoin or Litecoin transaction. During the analysis of
those relations we found out that some of them are ``spurious'': the wallets
seems to belong to different people.

After searching addresses we analyzed the number of hashtags that were
correlated to the addresses we collect: in most cases tweets that contains the
addresses are not the same of the one that contain the public key, that usually
is a response to the first one. So to perform that study we retrieve had to
retrieve the original tweet, that contains the hashtags. In
Figure~\ref{fig:hashtags} we could see the 20 most used hashtags: using that
finding it is possible to improve the search and target it on the most popular
hashtags. This study was done on 30\textsuperscript{th} April 2018, and 215 of
the 1079 tweets found out in the data retrieving phase were deleted. So even if
this result could be slightly different if the study was performed immediately
after the search we believe that is still a valid result. We explain the fact
that many tweets were deleted and their authors were suspended because of both
the spammy and suspicious nature of them: for example, some of account uses
misleading names to gain
money\footnote{e.g. \url{https://twitter.com/ButerinVilatik/} exploit a
misspelling of the name of creator of Ethereum Vitalik Buterin}. An important
finding of the study of hashtags is that they are used with different
capitalization, so a simple improvement of out system could be to contemplate
all possible uppercase-lowercase combination.
