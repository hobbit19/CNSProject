\subsection{Queries} 
\label{sec:queries}
In order to maximize the number of possible results in repositories we have
searched for files that contained words such as \textbf{donation} or
\textbf{contribution} and a set of characters that match regular expression
that we defined for different address formats. Instead, in order to query
Twitter we looked for the same things such as in repositories but also for
\textit{hashtags} such as \textbf{\#GiveAway} or for correlated hashtags
specific for a certain cryptocurrency (e.g. \#BTCGiveAway)
