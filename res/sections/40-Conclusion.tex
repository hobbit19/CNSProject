\section{Conclusion} \label{conclusion}
We implemented a system to bind Bitcoin's and altcoins' addresses to Twitter
and Github accounts. Further we removed false positives and elaborate the raw
data to retrieve other accounts following the principles described
in~\cite{bib:fistful}.
The results show that a large number of accounts is related to a big number of
wallets, altough that seems not so plausible because there are plenty of
examples of addresses marked as correlated that seems to be not under the
control of the same entity or to related entities (e.g. member of the same
company). This is probably due to two factors: the flooding of services
addressed to the users' anonymity, such as \texttt{CoinMixer} and the
appearance of multisig addresses. We could claim that nowadays the results
described in \cite{bib:fistful} are not so precise as in the past.
