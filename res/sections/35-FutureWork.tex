\section{Future work}
This project, as we said before, is a proof of concept and it could only gives
an indication of how much information you cold retrieve. A simple improvement
is to re-launch out program using premium keys (in particular for Twitter) and
searching for other altcoins that we have not considered. Another possible
improvement will be to increase the number of websites in which \texttt{Nduja}
makes its research: cryptocurrency dedicated forums or other social network,
e.g. Reddit, in which there is a section dedicated to this topic. Another
enhancement is to implement some heuristics to group Ethereum wallets, since in
this altcoins it is not possible to have multiple-inputs transaction. These
heuristics could take advantage of that it is not possible in Ethereum it is
not possible to open new wallets for each transaction~\cite{bib:ethersok}. Other
improvements are related to data mining: an important possibility could be
performing some analysis on account related to addresses to discover, if
possible, related account on other social networks~\cite{bib:osinference}.
Another possible improvement is to implement some sort of more sophisticated
pre-processing to discover as much services as possible, grouping all addresses
used from the same addresses in a single cluster. This could speed-up research,
discarding a priori a huge amount of wallets. A possible related future work is
profiling user and transaction: once the graph is created it is possible to
study vertexes, disclosing possible remuneration profiling (as described
in~\cite{bib:fullDiscl}) or profiling people associate with clusters. A simple
example could be this: if some user donate some money to a open source project,
probably she use it and if the project has some peculiarities you could infer
some information on the donating person.
